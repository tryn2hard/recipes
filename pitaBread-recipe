Method
These homemade pita bread are usually served with Greek suvlaki! They are
soft, puffy and a little more bread like!
Combine the sugar, yeast, water and milk in a bowl. Set the bowl aside for 5
minutes, until the mixture starts to froth.
In another bowl, combine the flour, the salt and the chopped fresh thyme
leaves and give it a mix to combine.
Add the oil to the yeast mixture and stir to combine.
Add the yeast mixture to the flour mixture in batches. Make sure each batch
is incorporated before adding the next.
Transfer mixture to a lightly floured working surface. Knead for 4-5 minutes
until the dough becomes smooth.
Brush a bowl with some oil and add the dough.
Cover with a towel and let it rest for about 40 minutes, until it rises and
doubles in size.
Place a pan over medium heat.
Press on the dough to remove the air and cut into 6 equal sized pieces.
Place pieces of dough on a lightly oiled working surface. Use a rolling pin to
roll out each piece of dough to a circle 20 cm in diameter.
Cook the pita bread for 1-2 minutes on each side in the pan, until they puff
up slightly.
Transfer to a plate and serve with chicken or pork gyro, sausages or
vegetables. Sprinkle with chopped thyme.
